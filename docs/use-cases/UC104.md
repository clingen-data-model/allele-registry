###Submit an amino acid allele instance (*UC104*)

**Description**
An amino acid allele instance is submitted, which existance in the *Registry* is unknown.

####Actors
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*

####Steps (assuming Pre-condition one is given).
1. The *Allele Registry* first checks in protein space then if needed allele space for previously registered Allele Instances.
2. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele has been registered, and returns the URI.
3. The *Allele Registry* return the URI of other known alleles, and canonical versions.


####Post-conditions

####Exceptions
- Allele Registry attempts to verify the protein change based on the reference given and determines that an incorrect annotation has taken place.
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.

####Questions/Comments
- Should the *Allele Registry* return the URI of other known alleles, the canonical version, or both?
