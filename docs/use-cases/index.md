UC02 | Submit an already known simple allele

3. Submit a new simple allele for a known canonical allele
4. Submit an amino acid simple allele
5. Query for the associated canonical alleles (given a nucleotide allele, what is the aa version, and vice versa)
6. Query for the canonical allele of a simple allele
7. Query for all the simple alleles of a canonical allele (just the known ones?)
8. Query for the prov of a simple allele
9. Query for the prov a canonical allele
10. Submit a haplotype consisting of multiple simple alleles, all of which are novel
11. Submit a haplotype consisting of known simple alleles, but with a novel combination
12. Submit a haplotype with novel simple alleles whose combination already has a complex canonical allele
13. Submit a simple allele on an unknown reference
14. Submit a simple allele that does not match the given reference
15. A new version of a reference sequence is added to the system
16. A change to a reference allele causes the invalidation of a canonical allele
