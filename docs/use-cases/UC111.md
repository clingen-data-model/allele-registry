###Submit a haplotype consisting of known simple alleles, but with a novel combination (*UC111*)

**Description**
Curator submits a collection of known SimpleAlleles as part of a haplotype but in a unique combination not currently in the *Allele Registry*.

####Actors
- *Curation Admin*
- *Curation Application*
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*

- None of the individual alleles of the haplotype previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, but combination is not known in the Registry.


####Steps
1. *Curation admin* requests a formal allele identifiers from the *Curation Application* for each of the alleles and the haplotype group.
2. The *Curation application* requests allele identifiers from the *Allele Registry* using one of the minimal required data sets (pre-conditions) for representing an allele.
3. The *Allele Registry* verifies the accuracy of reference information.
4. The *Allele Registry* determines that the all of the simpleAlleles are know, but discovers no know haplotype group.
5. The *Allele Registry* creates a new haplotype identifier linking all of the submitted simpleAllele together.
6. The *Allele Registry* return the URI of all the known simpleAlleles (pre-created URI's) and the new haplotype URL to the *Curation Application*.
7. The *Curation Application* captures the universal stable allele and haplotype identifiers and presents all forms to the *Curation admin*.

####Post-conditions
- The *Curation Application* would be responsible for preserving linkage between the identifier and the source representation of all the alleles and their association as a haplotype group.

####Exceptions
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
- Reference or alternate allele information not correct.
- Validation discovers that all alleles do not coexist or otherwise could not be present in the same haplotype.

####Questions/Comments
- Would the *Curation Application* not only return the novel haplotype group but any other simpleAllele or haplotype groups associated with the original request.
