###Submit a haplotype consisting of known allele instances, but with a novel combination (*UC111*)

**Description**
A collection of known AlleleInstances are submitted, which are part of a haplotype but in a unique combination not currently in the *Allele Registry*.

####Actors
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*
- None of the individual alleles of the haplotype previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, but combination is not known in the Registry.


####Steps
1. The *Allele Registry* verifies the accuracy of reference information.
2. The *Allele Registry* determines that the all of the alleleInstances are know, but discovers no know haplotype group.
3. The *Allele Registry* creates a new haplotype identifier linking all of the submitted alleleInstance together.
4. The *Allele Registry* return the URI of all the known alleleInstances (pre-created URI's) and the new haplotype URL.

####Post-conditions

####Exceptions
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
- Reference or alternate allele information not correct.
- Validation discovers that all alleles do not coexist or otherwise could not be present in the same haplotype.

####Questions/Comments
- Would the *Allele Registry* not only return the novel haplotype group but any other alleleInstance or haplotype groups associated with the original request.
