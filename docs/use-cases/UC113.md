###Submit a simple allele on an unknown reference (*UC113*)

**Description**
Curator submits a simpleAllele with an unknown reference (or reference missing).

####Actors
- *Curation Admin*
- *Curation Application*
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*

####Steps
1. *Curation admin* requests a formal allele identifiers from the *Curation Application* for the given simpleAllele.
2. The *Curation application* requests allele identifiers from the *Allele Registry* using one of the minimal required data sets (pre-conditions) for representing an allele.
3. The *Allele Registry* verifies the accuracy of reference information.
4. The *Allele Registry* reports that the reference information is invalid and returns exception report.
5. The *Curation Application* captures the exception report and presents it to the *Curation admin*.

####Post-conditions
- The *Allele Registry* would be responsible for returning (unambiguously) the reason the exception was found.
- The *Curation Application* would be responsible for reporting (unambiguously) the reason the exception was found.

####Exceptions
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
- Reference or alternate allele information not correct.
- Validation discovers that all alleles do not coexist or otherwise could not be present in the same haplotype.

####Questions/Comments
- This use-case seems very clear.  We should never registry data without clean, clear reference data. No exceptions.
- The above example also states the need for the Registry and any Applications to have detailed error reporting.
