### Submit an already known simple allele (*UC102*)

**Description**
Curator submits an allele that already exists in the registry

#### Actors
- *Curation Admin*
- *Curation Application*
- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- A DNA Sequence allele in one of the supported representations.
- The allele to be registered already exists in the registry already exists in the *allele registry*.

#### Steps

1. *Curation admin* requests a formal allele identifier from the *Curation Application* in order to capture specific evidence from one or more publications.
2. The *Curation application* requests an allele identifier from the *Allele Registry* using one of the allowable representations for representing an allele.
3. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified already exists.
4. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele (or universal identifier) to the *Curation Application*, along with a code that indicates the allele already exists and was discovered in the registry.

#### Post-conditions

- The *Curation Application* captures the universal stable identifier originaly generated by the *Allele Registry* for the original allele representation submitted by the *Curation Admin*.
- The *Curation Application* would be responsible for preserving linkage between the identifier and the source representation of the allele.

#### Exceptions
- Allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
