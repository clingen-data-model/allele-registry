### Submit a completely novel nucleotide contextual allele (*UC101*)

**Description**
A completely novel nucleotide contextual allele is submitted to the Allele Registry, and a canonical ID is returned.

#### Actors

- *Submitter*
- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- *Reference Data*
- The allele to be registered does not previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does the canonical representation of the allele representation.

#### Steps

1. The *Submitter* submits a nucleotide allele to an *Allele Registry* service in an accepted format (listed elsewhere).
2. The *Allele Registry* validates the allele, including syntactic checking, as well as verifying the reference sequence is known and the allele correlates correctly to the position that was submitted.
3. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified does not already exist. If it does, see [UC102](./UC102.md).
4. The *Allele Registry* canonicalizes the allele representation, and verifies that the canonical allele does not already exist. If it does, see [UC103](./UC103.md). 

    >NOTE: this is typically done by standardizing the submitted representation against a common genomic reference sequence which is supported by all registered contextual alleles and comparing it with other stored alleles based on the same sequence.  See handling of changes in repeating sequences (aka. Left-Right issue) within the [implementer's topics](../implementer_topics.md#approaches-to-handling-left-right-issue-at-submission). 

5. The *Allele Registry* generates the [contextual allele](../implementer_topics.md#generating--storing-all-v-submission-only-allele-instances) that corresponds to the submitted representation along with provenance denoting that the submitted representation was authored by the submitter and the generated contextual allele were created by the *Allele Registry* generation process as a result of the direct submission.

    >NOTE: Steps 6, 7, & 8 are based on implementer's choices on whether to generate and store additional representations of contextual alleles for the submitted representation.  See the [implementer's topics](../implementer_topics.md#generating--storing-all-v-submission-only-allele-instances) for more information on the impact of choices on these use case steps.

6. The *Allele Registry* may generate other nucleotide contextual alleles.
7. The *Allele Registry* may generate amino acid contextual alleles for each transcript contextual allele along with the associations.
8. The *Allele Registry* registers the amino acid contextual alleles as described in [UC104](./UC104.md).
9. The *Allele Registry* creates a canonical nucleotide allele aggregating all of the submitted and generated nucelotide contextual alleles.
10. The *Allele Registry* creates a provenance for the canonical nucleotide allele.
11. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele to the *Submitter*.

#### Post-conditions
- All representations (or instances?) of the submitted allele are available. 

#### Exceptions

- Submitted allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
