### Submit a completely novel nucleotide allele instance (*UC101*)

**Description**
A completely novel nucleotide allele instance is submitted to the Allele Registry, and a canonical ID is returned.

#### Actors

- *Submitter*
- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- *Reference Data*
- The allele to be registered does not previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does the canonical representation of the allele representation.

#### Steps

1. The *Submitter* submits a nucleotide allele to an *Allele Registry* service in an accepted format (listed elsewhere).
2. The *Allele Registry* validates the allele, including syntactic checking, as well as verifying the reference sequence is known and the allele correlates correctly to the position that was submitted.
3. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified does not already exist. If it does, see [UC102](./UC102.md).
4. The *Allele Registry* canonicalizes the allele representation, and verifies that the canonical allele does not already exist. If it does, see [UC103](./UC103.md). 

    >NOTE: this is typically done by standardizing the submitted representation against a common genomic reference sequence which is supported by all registered allele instances and comparing it with other stored alleles based on the same sequence.  See handling of changes in repeating sequences (aka. Left-Right issue) within the [implementer's topics](../implementation.md). 

5. The *Allele Registry* generates and stores the [allele instances](../implementer_topics.md#generating--storing-all-v-submission-only-allele-instances) that correspond to the submitted allele instance along with provenance denoting that the submitted instance was created by direct submission and the generated allele instances were created by the *Allele Registry* generation process as a result of the direct submission.


9. The *Allele Registry* generates amino acid allele instances for each transcript allele instance.
10. The *Allele Registry* associates each transcript allele instance with the generated amino acid allele instance.
11. The *Allele Registry* registers the amino acid allele instances as described in [UC104](./UC104.md).
12. The *Allele Registry* creates a canonical nucleotide allele aggregating all of the submitted and generated nucelotide allele instances.
13. The *Allele Registry* creates a provenance for the canonical nucleotide allele.
14. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele to the *Submitter*.

#### Post-conditions
- All representations (or instances?) of the submitted allele are available.

#### Exceptions

- Submitted allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
