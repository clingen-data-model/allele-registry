### Submit a completely novel nucleotide simple allele (*UC01*)

**Description**
A completely novel nucleotide simple allele is submitted to the Allele Registry, and a canonical ID is returned.

#### Actors

- *Submitter*
- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- *Reference Data*
- The allele to be registered does not previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does the canonical representation of the allele representation.

#### Steps

1. The *Submitter* submits a nucleotide allele to an *Allele Registry* service in an accepted format (listed elsewhere).
2. The *Allele Registry* validates the allele, including syntactic checking, as well as verifying the reference sequence.
3. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified does not already exist. If it does, see [UC102](./UC102.md).
4. The *Allele Registry* canonicalizes the allele representation, and verifies that the canonical allele does not already exist.  If it does, see [UC103](./UC103.md).
5. The *Allele Registry* generates the other nucleotide simple alleles that correspond to the submitted simple allele.
6. The *Allele Registry* stores simple allele objects for the submitted and generated simple alleles
7. The *Allele Registry* creates and stores a provenance for the submitted simple allele denoting that it was created by direct submission
8. The *Allele Registry* creates and stores provenace for the generated simple alleles denoting that they were created by generation based on the submitted simple allele
9. The *Allele Registry* generates simple amino acid alleles for each simple transcript allele.
10. The *Allele Registry* associates each simple transcript allel with the generated simple amino acid allele.
11. The *Allele Registry* registers the simple amino acid alleles as described in [UC104](./UC104.md).
12. The *Allele Registry* creates a canonical nucleotide allele aggregating all of the submitted and generated simple nucelotide alleles.
13. The *Allele Registry* creates a provenance for the canonical nucleotide allele.
14. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele to the *Submitter*.

#### Post-conditions

#### Exceptions

- Allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
