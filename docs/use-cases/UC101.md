### Submit a completely novel simple allele (*UC01*)

**Description**
Curator submits a completely novel simple allele to the Allele Registry.

#### Actors

- *Curation Admin*
- *Curation Application*
- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- *Reference Data*
- The allele to be registered does not previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does the canonical representation of the allele representation.

#### Steps

1. *Curation admin* requests a formal allele identifier from the *Curation Application* in order to capture specific evidence from one or more publications.
2. The *Curation application* requests an allele identifier from the *Allele Registry* using one of the allowable representations for representing an allele.
3. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified does not already exist and registers it. 
4. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele (or universal identifier) to the *Curation Application*.
5. The *Curation Application* captures the universal stable allele identifier and presents all relevant forms of the allele to the *Curation admin*.

#### Post-conditions

- The *Curation Application* captures a universal stable identifier authorized by the *Allele Registry* for the original allele representation submitted by the *Curation Admin*.
- The *Curation Application* would be responsible for preserving linkage between the identifier and the source representation of the allele.

#### Exceptions

- Allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.

#### Questions/Comments

- Is the *Allele Registry* responsible for capturing and retaining the originally submitted data that resolved to a specific allele URI?  (I think not, it should be the responsibility of systems external to the *Allele Registry* to maintain submission tracking kinds of behavior.  However, wouldn't the original request be needed for provenance sake?  And, if so, then would we not need to capture other requested representations that resolved to it?)
