### Submit a completely novel simple allele (*UC01*)

**Description**
A completely novel simple allele is submitted to the Allele Registry.

#### Actors

- *Allele Registry*

#### Pre-conditions

- *Reference Data*
- The allele to be registered does not previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does the canonical representation of the allele representation.

#### Steps

1. The *Allele Registry* determines that the allele representation specified does not already exist.
2. The *Allele Registry* registers the allele representation.
3. The *Allele Registry* canonicalizes the allele representation.
4. The *Allele Registry* returns the URI of the canonical allele (or universal identifier).

#### Post-conditions

#### Exceptions

- Allele representation is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.

#### Questions/Comments

- Is the *Allele Registry* responsible for capturing and retaining the originally submitted data that resolved to a specific allele URI?  (I think not, it should be the responsibility of systems external to the *Allele Registry* to maintain submission tracking kinds of behavior.  However, wouldn't the original request be needed for provenance sake?  And, if so, then would we not need to capture other requested representations that resolved to it?)
