###Submit a haplotype consisting of multiple simple alleles, all of which are novel (*UC110*)

**Description**
Curator submits a collection of SimpleAlleles occurring as a haplotype (complexSimpleAllele) all of which are thought to be novel.

####Actors
- *Curation Admin* 
- *Curation Application*
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*
- None of the allele of the haplotype previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does a canonical representation occur.

####Steps
1. *Curation admin* requests formal allele identifiers from the *Curation Application* for each of the allele of the haplotype.
2. The *Curation application* requests an allele identifier from the *Allele Registry* using one of the minimal required data sets (pre-conditions) for representing an allele.
3. The *Allele Registry* verifies the accuracy of reference information.
4. The *Allele Registry* determines that the alleles represented do not already exist as individual simpleAlleles or as a haplotype.
5. All SimpleAlleles are registered.
6. Canonical forms of all SimpleAlles are created.
7. Haplotype identifier is created.
8. The *Allele Registry* return the URI of all simpleAlleles (novel so would return the canonical URL's), and the haplotype URL to the *Curation Application*.
9. The *Curation Application* captures the universal stable allele identifiers and presents all forms to the *Curation admin*.

####Post-conditions
- The *Curation Application* would be responsible for preserving linkage between the identifier and the source representation of all the alleles and their association as a haplotype group.

####Exceptions
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
- Reference or alternate allele information not correct.
- Validation discovers that all alleles do not coexist or otherwise could not be present in the same haplotype.

####Questions/Comments
- What steps would be needed in cases were 2/3 of the above alleles were known but were not recorded as being part of the same haplotype?  Would the *Allele Registry* return any future request with all known alleles and any haplotype groups they are registered with?  This type of return would be very valuable.
