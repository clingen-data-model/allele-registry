###Submit a haplotype consisting of multiple allele instances, all of which are novel (*UC110*)

**Description**
A collection of AlleleInstances are submitted occurring as a haplotype (complexAlleleInstance) all of which are thought to be novel.

####Actors
- *Allele Registry*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference Data*
- None of the allele of the haplotype previously exist in the *Allele Registry*, nor does a canonical representation occur.

####Steps
1. The *Allele Registry* verifies the accuracy of reference information.
2. The *Allele Registry* determines that the alleles represented do not already exist as individual alleleInstances or as a haplotype.
3. All AlleleInstances are registered.
4. Canonical forms of all AlleleInstances are created.
5. Haplotype identifier is created.
6. The *Allele Registry* return the URI of all alleleInstances and haplotype URL.

####Post-conditions

####Exceptions
- HGVS is invalid
- Invalid reference sequence identifier or reference sequence not loaded in repository.
- Reference or alternate allele information not correct.
- Validation discovers that all alleles do not coexist or otherwise could not be present in the same haplotype.

####Questions/Comments
- What steps would be needed in cases were 2/3 of the above alleles were known but were not recorded as being part of the same haplotype?  Would the *Allele Registry* return any future request with all known alleles and any haplotype groups they are registered with?  This type of return would be very valuable.
