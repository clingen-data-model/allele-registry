###A change to a reference allele causes the invalidation of a canonical allele. (*UC116*)

**Description**
A update or correction of referece information invalidates one (many) canonical alleles.

####Actors
- *Allele Registry*
- *Allele Registry Admin*

####Pre-conditions
- New reference data added to the Allele Registry.

####Steps
1. *Allele Registry Admin add new reference information to the *Allele Registry*.
2. The *Allele Registry* return all alleles (and associated haplotypes groups) to the admin which have invalid references.
3. *Allele Registry Admin* executes [LiftOver](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver) attempting to resolve conflicts.
4. Any remaining alleles which can not be resolved change to inactive state until rectified.

####Post-conditions
- The *Allele Registry* and *Allele Registry Admin* should be responsible for maintaining changes to new reference builds.
- Remaining unresolved alleles (after LiftOver) should be handled by both the admin and the original submitter.
- *Allele Registry Admin* should be tasked with trying to resolve simple build changes, but mainly it should be the responsibility of the original submitter to correct data issue.
- Their should be a set time limit for the original submitter to correct data before submitted alleles are removed.

####Exceptions
- None to note at this time.
