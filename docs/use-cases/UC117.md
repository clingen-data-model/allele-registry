###Two canonical alleles are found to represent the same entity within Allele Registry (*UC117*)

**Description**
An internal review of the canonical alleles result in duplicate or misrepresentation data.

####Actors
- *Allele Registry*
- *Allele Registry Admin*
- *Internal code base*

####Pre-conditions
- *Reference data*

####Steps
1. User, *Allele Registry Admin* or *Allele Registry* discovers duplicate or misrepresentation data.
2. *Allele Registry* uses *Internal code base* to review all representation from multiple sources (i.e. protein, HGVS, genomic) to test for errors, misrepresentations typo, etc.
3. Return lists to *Allele Registry Admin* from both _found differences_ and _no differences_.
4. Based on review, changes are made to the *Allele Registry*.

####Post-conditions
- *Allele Registry Admin* will need to adjudicate reason why differences are discovered and make changes to the *Registry*.

####Exceptions

####Questions/Comments
- A Use Case like this brings up the question if formal rules will be needed to adjudicate difference found, and what process that will take.
