#Pre-conditions


## Reference data

When using the *Allele Registry* both the system and the user will be expect to supply reference data to allow the correct canonicalization of alleles.

#### System Reference data
The *Allele Registry* will need to internally maintain and update all known (or pre-decided selection of) Genome build assemblies (RefSeq), reference transcripts, and genome feature files (GFF3).


#### User Reference data
The *Curation Admin* or registered user will need to supply equivalent reference data in relation to their allele of interest.
